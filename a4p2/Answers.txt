What is the result and implication of removing the code while(t==ticks)? Elaborate on your answer. 

- The purpose of the while is for waiting for ticks to finish the execution of computeSomething, If there was no while loop
the threads with the computeSomething will execute one after another without waiting. It will print and then terminate directly without waiting

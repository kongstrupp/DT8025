What is the result and implication of removing the code while(t==ticks)? Elaborate on your answer. 

- The purpose of the while is for waiting for ticks to finish the execution of computeSomething, If there was no while loop
the threads with the computeSomething will execute one after another without waiting. It will print and then terminate directly without waiting.
If we comment the while loop, the behavior of the code will be such that it executes all the readyQ threads in one second and they so
they will print the same value.

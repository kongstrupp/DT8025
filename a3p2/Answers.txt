1.What is the purpose of the function spawn?

- Give a function memory space, and enqueue it for later execution in the readyQ.

2.What is the purpose of the function dispatch?

- Move to the next thread in the ready queue and then exit the current thread and set the current to the dispatched thread.

3.What is the purpose of the function yield?

- Enqueing the current thread and dequeing the next thread for dispatch.

4.After finishing the execution of line 3, describe the content of readyQ.

- We will enqueue the thread newp that conatins the thread with the function (computePower) and that thread  will have the argument 0, the thread newp
will be found in the readyQ. 

5.After finishing the execution of line 3, describe the content of freeQ.

- The freeQ will conatin 4 empty thread blocks. There is five at the beginning and one is used by the spawn function after line 3.  

6.Consider the code above and the a3p1.img kernel from Pat 1. Which task executes first? Why?

- The computePrimes function will execute (the main thread), and the computePower function is enqued and will be will dispatched when the computesPrimes function triggers yield() in its if-statment.
ComputePrimes is executed first because computePower is only enqued for later execution. 

7.As they are, functions computePower and computePrimes execute indefinitely, i.e, never return. However, and considering the a3p1.img kernel, these functions are executed concurrently. How?

- They are not executed concurrently they switch between each other so fast it will appear as if they were executing concurrently. What happens is that when one of these functions calls yield,
the current thread is dispatched and the next thread in the readyQ will start executing until that threads function calls yield, and then it repeats. 

8.Again, computePower and computePrimes never return. However, consider a situation when these functions return. This implies that the tiny thread assigned to execute the task will terminate. 
Consequently, if you want or need to execute a task again, you might need to track which tiny threads terminated. 
One approach is to keep information about the terminated threads in a list called doneQ. Thus, where in lib/tinythreads.c, would add the tiny thread that terminated into doneQ?

- When you jump back to the if-statment in the spawn function, just before you put current to NULL you should add the current in the doneQ.
